# Hi!

My name is Sveinung, and I am a political scientist whose research revolves around democratic theory, public opinion, and electoral behavior.
I am the Norwegian national coordinator of the [European Social Survey](www.europeansocialsurvey.org).
I also lead a research group on democracy and innovation, which conducts research on democratic legitimacy.
